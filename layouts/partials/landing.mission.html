        Neuroscience at the forefront of science and dissolves disciplinary boundaries and promotes transdisciplinary research. This is a process that, in principle, can facilitate discovery by convergent efforts from theoretical, experimental, systems and cognitive neuroscience, as well as computer science and engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
To assure the success of this process, the current lack of established mechanisms to guarantee reproducibility of scientific results must be overcome. Promoting open software and data sharing has become paramount to address reproducibility.

        <p>
 This project addresses challenges to reproducibility by providing mechanisms for publishing data, and algorithms while embedding them with computing resources to impact multiple scientific communities.
